# Engineering Mathematics Projects (University of Tehran)


## Overview

This repository contains two MATLAB projects completed as part of the **Engineering Mathematics** course at the  **University of Tehran** . The projects focus on the application of **Fourier Analysis** and **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** in solving engineering-related problems.

### Project 1: Fourier Analysis

This project introduces the use of **Fourier Series** and **Fourier Transforms** to analyze and solve functions in both the time and frequency domains. Key elements include:

* **Introduction to MATLAB** : Basic commands for plotting and working with matrices.
* **Fourier Series Calculation** : Implementing MATLAB functions to compute the Fourier series of a given function and comparing the result with the original function.
* **Fourier Transform** : Applying Fourier transforms to functions and analyzing the frequency domain representation.
* **Sampling Frequency** : Understanding the concept of sampling frequency through an audio signal analysis task.

#### Key Topics:

* Plotting functions in MATLAB
* Computing Fourier Series and Fourier Transform
* Harmonic Analysis in Fourier Series
* Audio signal processing

### Project 2: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

This project focuses on solving **Partial Differential Equations** (PDEs) such as the **Heat Equation** and the **Helmholtz Equation** using MATLAB. Key steps include:

* **Solving the Heat Equation** : Implementing MATLAB functions to solve the heat equation for a one-dimensional rod with specific boundary and initial conditions.
* **Solving the Helmholtz Equation** : Analyzing and solving the Helmholtz equation in a specific region and visualizing the results using MATLABâ€™s PDE Modeler.

#### Key Topics:

* Solving PDEs using MATLAB
* Boundary and initial conditions for PDEs
* Visualization of solutions (2D and 3D plots)

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* **EXTRA/** : Contains additional files related to the projects.
* **Projects/** : Contains the MATLAB scripts and functions for both projects.
* **README.md** : Documentation for the projects.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the corresponding scripts for each project:
   * For  **Fourier Analysis** , open and run the script: `fourier_analysis.m`.
   * For  **PDEs** , open and run the script: `heat_equation_solver.m` or `helmholtz_solver.m`.
